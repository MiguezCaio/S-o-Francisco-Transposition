# Impact Evaluation of the Rerouting of a major river in Brazil
The Transposition of São Francisco River is a major infraestructure orchestrated in brazil from 2005-2022 with several delays on the original project. Its goal was to provide a steady flow of water into several temporary rivers in the dry region of the Northeast of Brazil. My goal with this project is to exploit the delays and staggered expansion of the transposition to assess its impact on the livelihood of people in the Region. In this repository, I intend to disponibilizar some of the code that made possible this venture.

## Code
I used mostly Python for Data Extraction and R for maps and estimation, alongside some google earth for a bigger grasp on the maps. 

### Reservoirs
Since the official reason for the mega project was to turn temporary rivers on the interior of the Northeast to permanent ones, the first stage of my research is to delve deeper into the reservoir data on the region. A first "sucess" would indicate that reservoirs affected by the transposition had a bigger volume of water all year. 
First, I scraped the website of the offical Agency of waters in Brazil to get this data (the code can be found here).
