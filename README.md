# Impact Evaluation of the rerouting of a major river in Brazil
The transposition of the São Francisco River stands as one of Brazil’s most ambitious infraestructure projects. Initiated in 2005 and implemented in phases until 2022, the project was designed to provide a steady supply of water to formerly temporary river systems in Brazil’s arid Northeast. My project takes advantage of the inherent delays and staggered rollout of the transposition to evaluate its socio-economic and environmental impacts on local communities. This repository documents the analytical methods and code that made this research possible.

## Project Overview
**Research Focus:**
* **Main Question:** How does increasing the steady supply of water affect agricultural productivity, household access to water, and overall local development?
* **Key Outcomes:** Changes in reservoir water levels, shifts in agricultural output, and improvements in water accessibility.

## Code
I used mostly Python for Data Extraction and R for maps and estimation, alongside some google earth for a bigger grasp on the maps. 

### Reservoirs
A core aspect of the project is examining the impact on reservoirs. Since the transposition aimed to transform temporary rivers into reliable water sources, one early indicator of success is whether reservoirs in the affected areas maintain higher water levels year-round. For this purpose, I developed scripts to scrape reservoir data from the official Brazilian water agency’s website and compare water volume trends before and after the project’s implementation.

## Maps

Interactive maps have been created to illustrate the transposition routes and the locations of key reservoirs. These maps provide a visual overview of the project’s geographical scope and are integral to understanding the spatial distribution of water resources across the region.
